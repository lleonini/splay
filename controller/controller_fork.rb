# This file will execute all the daemons (including multiple splayds and logds) on
# this computer. Because DBI is not fork safe (if a process halt, the connection
# is closed), we give a different DB connection to every process. We do that too
# because ruby (1.8) threads are not efficient and a splayd (daemon) will have
# dificulties to manage more than 100 threads (=> splayds).
#
# Each 'daemon' can be run standalone. Following the example in this file, you can
# see how easily you would be able to run multiple splayd/jobs on multiple
# computers.
