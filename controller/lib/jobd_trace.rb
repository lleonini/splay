# Trace format:
# One line for each node with numbers describing the switch between up and down.
# Initial nodes must have a 0 at the beginning of their trace. By default, all
# initial nodes receive the list of all other initial nodes. Then, each node
# that becomes up receive the list of all nodes up before it comes.
# 
# We will register the job on every nodes.
#
# Example:
# 0 100 200
# 0 200 300
# 10 100 200 300
# 200
# 100 300
#
# 0: initial nodes (1 and 2) will be started and receive each of them in the list.
# 10: node 3 is started
# 100: node 1 and 3 are killed, node 5 is started and receive node 2 in the list.
# 200: node 2 is killed, nodes 1, 3 and 4 are started, they receive 5 in their list.
# 300: node 3 and 5 killed, node 2 start and receive 1 and 4 in their list.
#
# We will select the needed number of host * factor, so we will have a security
# if some goes down, we will not select new ones dinamically now.
#
# The precision depends of the splayd daemons latencies + job daemon latency +
# network latency => With the current settings don't expect better than +- 2
# seconds precision.
#
# NOTE
#
# Another problem: if a node, selected for the trace job, has a problem and
# comes back, it can be selected in splayd selection but it has been reset, so
# it has no more the job informations. To fix that, we have added a 'reset'
# entry in splayd_selections. When a node comes back with reset, all the entries
# in splayd_selections.reset are set to true.
#
# We send START even if status is UNAVAILABLE, because, if the splayd comes back
# not reset, it may then receive a STOP (without the previous START), that will
# raise an error (UNKNOWN_REF). A solution to that, will, in case where we add
# an action STOP and the action START is already queued, to remove both (but
# that can't be done so easily in general case because we need to deal with LIST
# and REGISTER too). But the solution to send all the command is not bad, in
# some case, splayd will come back a little later and will play its trace quite
# completly.
